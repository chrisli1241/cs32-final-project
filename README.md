# cs32-final-project
CS32 Project with Chris Li and Andrew Chen 
For our project we hope to create a battleship game using a server and a client that constructs a game board using ASCII characters and simulates the game Battleship in the python shell. Each player is able to view their own game board during every turn to see their own ships and where they have missed or hit their opponent's ships.
